Polymorphism- Poly-> Many and morphism -> Behaviour

There is something which behaves differently in different situation

In the World of OOPS , the same object or reference will have different behaviour based on how we create the instance of it ?

Types:
- Compile Time Polymorphism (Early Binding)
- Run Time Polymorphism     (Late Binding)

** Overloading is compile time.
 
 ex: if we have 2 methods 
  
     add(int,int)
     add(int,int,int)
     
     Now which method must be executed will be decided at Compile time.
     
** Overriding at Run Time.

ex:  
    class A{
        
        add(int,int)
    }
    
    class B{
        add(int,int)
    }
    
    Now which method would be executed [add in A or add in B ] is decided at Run Time.
    so it is called Run Time Polymorphism ie. Method Overriding.
